# STAAD.Pro - Air Washer Building Structural Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains the structural analysis and design of an **air washer building with a 20,000L rooftop water tank** using STAAD.Pro. The project was completed under the guidance of **Dr. Romanbabu Oinam**, Associate Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, **IIT Guwahati**.

## Project Objectives

- Perform comprehensive structural analysis of an air washer building under gravity and seismic loads
- Design critical structural elements (beams, columns, and footings)
- Design and verify a circular water tank structure
- Ensure structural adequacy and compliance with Indian building codes

## Scope of Work

### 1. **Building Analysis & Design**
- **Gravity Loads**: Dead and live loads as per IS 875: 1987
- **Seismic Loads**: Earthquake analysis as per IS 1893: 2002
- **Design Standards**: Reinforced cement concrete (RCC) design as per **IS 456: 2000**
- **Critical Elements Designed**:
  - Beams
  - Columns
  - Footings
  - Reinforcement detailing and placement

### 2. **Circular Water Tank Design**
- **Tank Capacity**: 20,000 Liters
- **Design Standard**: IS 3370 (Code of practice for concrete structures for storage of liquids)
- **Verification**: Comparison of analytical results with STAAD.Pro output
- **Structural Adequacy**: Confirmation of design safety and serviceability

## Key Features

✓ Complete structural modeling in STAAD.Pro  
✓ Comprehensive load calculations (gravity + seismic)  
✓ Detailed reinforcement design  
✓ Comparison with code provisions  
✓ Verification of structural adequacy  

## Design Codes & Standards Used

| Code/Standard | Description |
|---|---|
| **IS 456: 2000** | Plain and reinforced concrete - Code of practice |
| **IS 1893: 2002** | Criteria for earthquake resistant design of structures |
| **IS 3370** | Concrete structures for storage of liquids |
| **IS 875: 1987** | Code of practice for design loads (other than earthquake) |
